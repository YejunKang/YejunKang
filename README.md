## Hi, I'm Yejun!

I'm a prospective CS major with a strong interest in the fields of Game Development, AI, Finance, and Web development. 

I self-taught myself Java during COVID-19 creating Minecraft mods and I have had a love for programming ever since.

I'm currently a rising Junior in high school.

## Some things I am looking forward to working on:
- Making passion projects relating to quantitative finance
- Furthering my knowledge with Java frameworks and exploring other programming languages
- Familiarizing myself with the Godot game engine
